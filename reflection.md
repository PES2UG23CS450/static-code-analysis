Which issues were the easiest to fix, and which were the hardest? Why?
Easiest to fix was the naming function being messy and the structure of the code being messy and the hardest were the ones involving security issues as it required to think of coding in a way which ensured security and good coding behaviour

Did the static analysis tools report any false positives? If so, describe one example.
yes. Example : Error Code: F401 'logging' imported but unused
but logging was later used

How would you integrate static analysis tools into your actual software development
workflow? Consider continuous integration (CI) or local development practices.
Would use it to check the security risks the code may have and for good clean readability of the code

What tangible improvements did you observe in the code quality, readability, or potential
robustness after applying the fixes?
The security risks were noticed and fixed and the code is much better and readable
